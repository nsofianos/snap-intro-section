## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Responsive design aint easy! Mobile-first seems to make the process quicker, as less things seem to break scaling up to desktop mode (as opposed to vice versa).

### Useful resources
